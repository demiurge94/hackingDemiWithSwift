##Project 1: Wallpaper Viewer (original is Storm Viewer)
This project creates a simple iOS application that lists a number of images which the user can tap on to view. I used my personal wallpaper folder for the images with the extension .jpg for the project.

##Project 2: Guess the Flag
This project is a game that shows random flags to users asking them to choose which
one belongs to a particular country.
