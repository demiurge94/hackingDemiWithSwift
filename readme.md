<h2>Project 1: Wallpaper Viewer (original is Storm Viewer) </h2>
<p>This project creates a simple iOS application that lists a number of images which the user can tap on to view. I used my personal wallpaper folder for the images with the extension .jpg for the project.</p>

<h2>Project 2: Guess the Flag</h2>
<p>This project is a game that shows random flags to users asking them to choose which
one belongs to a particular country. I completed the wrap up challenges as well. This
includes showing the player's score in the navigation bar, keeping track of questions
answered and showing a final score after 10 before resetting, and when user chooses
wrong flag they're told "wrong, this is the flag of X". </p>
